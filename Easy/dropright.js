 /* Learn Lodash (4): _.dropRight, Drop the Last Elements of an Array

This challenge requires you to write your own version of this function without using lodash so that you can better understand it works.

Examples
dropRight([1, 2, 3]) ➞ [1, 2]

dropRight([1, 2, 3], 2) ➞ [1]

dropRight([1, 2, 3], 5) ➞ []

dropRight([1, 2, 3], 0) ➞ [1, 2, 3]
Notes
Do not attempt to import lodash; you are simply writing your own version.
